# Linear-Regression-Model
This repository is dedicated to practicing the mathematical functions learned in linear regression without relying on high-level libraries to handle complex calculations. The goal is to manually implement and understand the core mathematical concepts behind linear regression, including:

Correlation Calculation: Determining the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
Inclination Calculation: Computing the slope of the regression line that best fits the data.
Intercept Calculation: Finding the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis.
Prediction: Using the regression model to make predictions based on new input values.
This approach ensures a deeper understanding of the underlying math and avoids the abstraction of complex libraries. The code includes implementations for calculating correlation, inclination, intercept, and making predictions using linear regression.
