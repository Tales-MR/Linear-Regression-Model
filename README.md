# Small-Linear-Regression-Model
<p>
  This repository is dedicated to practicing the mathematical functions learned in linear regression without relying on high-level libraries to handle complex calculations. The goal is to manually implement and understand the core mathematical concepts behind linear regression, including:
</p>

<h2>Correlation Calculation:</h2>
<p>
  Determining the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
</p>

<h2>Inclination Calculation:</h2>
<p>
  Computing the slope of the regression line that best fits the data.
</p> 

<h2>Intercept Calculation:</h2>
<p>
  Finding the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis.
</p>

<h2>Prediction:</h2>
<p>
  Using the regression model to make predictions based on new input values.
</p>


<p>
  This approach ensures a deeper understanding of the underlying math and avoids the abstraction of complex libraries. The code includes implementations for calculating correlation, inclination, intercept, and making predictions using linear regression.
